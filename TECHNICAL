- Slow computer can cause "read zero on serial port". Pentium 120MHz or
faster is recomeneded.

----- Monitor Feature -----

Test:
Monitor 10 preset channels for 1 hours. Command script is "mp3.sh" and
"freq.mon" in example directory. It records sound in mp3 format and
save the file to disk using differrent name depending on frequency of the
channel. If the channale becomes inactive, QtPCR waits for 50 milliseconds
and move to the next one. 

Known Problem from previous versions:

- Serial port was locked up because child process had serial port
file descriptor. This was fixed by settting close-on-exec flag on the
file descriptor using fnctl.

- Read return zero after running monitor for 30 minutes. This was fixed
by setting terminal parameters in non-canonical mode. See Serial-Program
ming.html in www.linuxdoc.org for detail.


----- Power On / Off ------

Test:
Turn radio on and off.

Known Problems from previous versions:

- QtPCR cound not detect if the power is on or off. It blindly activated
graphic controls
