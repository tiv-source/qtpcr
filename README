QtPCR is under GPL2. In a nutshell, do what you want with
the code as long as it's not for profit, and publish your
source code.

Installation
============

1) Make sure you have Qt-Library version 2.x.x installed. If
you don't have it yet, download it from www.trolltech.com.

2) Edit 'Makefile'. Make sure following entries have correct
path:

INCPATH = -I/usr/lib/qt/include
LIBS = -L/usr/lib/qt
MOC = /usr/bin/moc

3) Build program by executing command:

# cd src
# make

4) Create symbolic link '/dev/pcr1000' to your serial port.
For example, if your PCR-1000 is connected to COM1, you can
execute command:

# ln -s /dev/ttyS0 /dev/pcr1000

5) Make sure you have read/write permission to the device above.

6) Enjoy!
