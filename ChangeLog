    - Resolve Qt 3.0 compatibility isse
    - Tested on Debian "Potato" by Adrien
 
8/08/2001
    - Tested on FreeBSD 4.3, Slackware 8.0, and Mandrake 8.0
8/04/2001
    - Add 12.5kHz Stepsize (suggested by Ken, G3WCS)
8/03/2001
    - Clean compiler waring on modectrl.cpp
    - Add <stdlib.h> in scandialog.h ( required on Mandrake )
    - Make it Mandrake 8.0 Compatible (./configure)
    - Keypad lost focus to Barscope's click
8/02/2001
    - Tested on FreeBSD 4.3 ,  run smooth ...
    - FreeBSD 4.3 needs (setspeed/getspeed routine)
    - Remove ./configure only use Makefile for now
    - FreeBSD 4.3 compatible (remove error.h, add delay in initializ )
7/31/2001
    - add keyPad->setFocus() in initialization QtPcr.

 
... Vacation ...

    - Jmm suggested adding optimization compilation flag -O2. Done!
    - Jmm suggested adding alarm command after done scanning. Done!
    - Jmm suggested adding 9kHz and 3kHz step size. Done
    - Limit the repaint() in meter dialog to wait at least 50 millisec
    because human eyes are not sensitive enought to detect any thing 
    faster anyhow. This helps on system ad hoc issue.
    - Jmm reports that meter dialog causes system ad hoc when the
    signal level changes really fast
    - Clean source according to -Wall warning
    - Jmm add <sys/time.h> in pcrio.h
6/12/2001
    - resize Channel dialog
    - implement key() in listviewitem to sort properly
6/07/2001
    - report read zero bytes too
    - set keyboard focus to keypad window by default
    - Terje reports problem when compile in BSD, BSDLY not
    definded .... etc
    - close all file descriptor on exec exept 0, 1, and 2
    - change termio to be more compatible , also set DTR RTS hight
    - example scripts failed to exit properly
    - Forgot to prevent child process from getting a hold of 
    serial port fd. If the child messes up, it also locks serial port
------------------- Release version 1.1 ---------------------------
6/06/2001
    - Done working monitor channel
6/05/2001
    - FIX SERIOSS BUG ... pcrio killed timer when read return 0
    - look into squelOn correction setting before monitoring
    - lookinto signal channel monitor 
    - deadlock fixed, wait for testing
    - monitor has deadlock problem
    - terminated myteriously while monitoring (record file shows zerobyte)
      meaning the child exit really quick
    - QtPCR now begins monitoring at correct frequency
    - Bug found: monitor begin incorrect currentItem
    - kill all childs after done monitoring 
    - don't forget to kill all sucker child after stop monitoring
    - handler exiting child process, kill defunct
    - Solved: forgot to check if signal is on/off really quick 
    - Problem: scan, and sig gone dead after monitoring for a while
    - Check dependency in Makefile.in
    - Bug fix: Scandialog, mark button was diable after load pixmap
    - Begin add monitor dialog
-------------------- Release version 1.0  finally ------------

6/04/2001
    - Add info box in Channel database
    - Bug Fixed: forget to strip newline when readln from file
    - Add pause button
    - Add tool tips
    - Organize source codes
    - Scan Dialog: Take out filter , and mode edit box as
    they are redundant with control dialog
    - Scan Dialog: increase canvas height to 310 to prevent
    nasty tile effect
    - Scan Dialog: click on screen to set radio frequency
    - Scan Dialog: add "Mark" button to set frequency marker
    in case of loading pixmap from file.
    - Scan Dialog: experiment with simple exponential decay
    see which one works better
    - the filter works well with narrow FM, but sucks at wide FM.
    so I just gonna make it one of the options instead.
    - Scan dialog: experiment with proportional integral filter
    that is used to adjust signal strength coming out from pcr-1000
    - Scan dialog: Add loop, lock, algorithm, and scale buttons
    - Scan dialog: Clear all screen before loading new pixmap.
6/03/2001
    - Change canvas height to 300 
6/02/2001
    - Try to add 3 secon sync time before scan
    - Take out canvas resize becaues we now have a better scan algorithm
    - Properly resize canvas after scan finished (might needed to be
      change in case of more sophisticat scan )
    - Read returns zero resolved. Just closed and reopen serial port
    - Change scanning algorithm to fixed stepsize util I can
      resolve read returning zero bytes. Problem.
      When occurs, bandscope goes down, signal stregn still
      fucntioning but slow. Need to reset serial port. Close,
      and then open again should help. Also need to stop 
      those scanning and other activity for awhile too.

    - Try to open radio serial port at different baud rate.
      Both 9600 and 38400. Hence, you can now just exit program
      and still be able to use it.
    - Change scaning algorithm to Sig change driven (could hoc radio)
    - Bug: smart_reset info failed to find absolute vale 
    - Forgot to call setTS() in pcrproxy.cpp in constructor
    - Change default step size (TS) to 10kHz
    - Add Tips feature. It displays at the beginning
      of the programs. Edit tips.h for change.
6/01/2001
    - Rename folder when double clicked
    - Forgot to initilize pcrinfo.device
------------ Begin Pre 1.0 release ----------------
6/01/2001
    - Major change.
      Add Channel database
      Add Scan function

5/25/2001 
	- Fix IF shift (untested)
	- Added low frequency step size, as suggested by Dave, VK5DG.
	- Put all radio feature in pcrproto.h
	- Fix Dial bug. It turned right eventhough reached max value
	- Fix Bandscope bug. It ignore low step size setting

--------------- Begin Beta release ------------------
5/5/2001 - Bug fixed

When QtPCR failed to initialize radio (i.e. /dev/pcr1000 
doesn't exist, unaccessible), the POWER button could not
be re-activated to turn on the radio.

5/5/2001 - Change executable file name to 'qtpcr'
