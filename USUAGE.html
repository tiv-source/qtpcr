<p><a name="H1">1. Turn on/off radio</a>
<br>
In radio control dialog, click POWER buttons. QtPCR will 
pop up several choices.

<p><a name="H2">2. Set alias for channel</a>
<br>
In radio control dialog, double click on area just above
frequency display. That area will become a text box, and
you can enter anything in that box. Hit Enterafter finishing.

<p><a name="H3">3. Enter additional information for channel</a>
<br>
In radio control dialog, double click on area below mode 
display (e.g AFC, AGC, NB ). The bandscope will become
a text box. Enter any info in the box and double click
below mode display again.

<p><a name="H4">4. Record sound in mp3 format</a>
<br>
You need mp3 encoder. One good choice is a program called "lame".
Once you download and compiled it, make sure you can record sound
while not using QtPCR

<p>
After making sure "lame" runn properly, choose "mp3" preset in
monitor dialog.

<p><a name="H5">5. Monitor preset channels</a>
<br>
In monitor dialog, you have to add channels into monitoring list.
This can be done by clicking "Add" buttons in the dialog, or
click "Monitor" button in channle dialog.

<p>
One powerful feature in QtPCR is that it can execute script program
when events happpen. In monitor dialog, you will notice edit box
Start, On, Off, and Stop command. You can enter any command in the
box by first click Option button. After editing all command, click
Option again.

<p>
You can load preset command set by clicking "Load" button. As
a tutorial session, try loading file "freq.mon" and use "echo"
preset command. Study the command for a while , you'll see how
it works easily

<p>
If you are new to Linux, BE CAREFUL when you edit these command. 
List any automatic script, if you are not careful, the effect is
unpredictable.

<p><a name="H6">6. Choose preset monitor command</a>
<br>
In monitor dialog, load preset command file by click "Load". See
example file "freq.mon"  Once you loaded the command sets, click
preset combo box.

<p><a name="H7">7. What are these $FREQ and $TIME</a>
<br>
Just like a shell has its own variable, QtPCR also has internal
variable that you can use when exeucte shell script. These variables
are, for example, $FREQ, $TIME, $ONPID, $OFFPID, $STARTPID, $STOPPID.
Look in "monitor.cpp" subroutine MonitorDialog::ExecuteCmd for 
details.

<p><a name="H8">8. Rename folder name in channel database</a>
<br>
Double click the folder

<p><a name="H9">9. What do these edit boxes in Monitor dialog mean</a>
<br>
"Elapse (msec)" is the maximum time QtPCR will stay in that channels
when it is active. While in that channel, you can record sound and
do many things. A good range is about 3000 millsecond.

<br>
"Step (msec)" is the time QtPCR will wait before moving to the next
channel in case it is in-active. The smaller the faster and more
efficient it becomes. A good range is about 100 millisecond.
