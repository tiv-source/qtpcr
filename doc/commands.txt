When the radio is first turned on, the following are sent

H101 ' turns the radio on
G4? ' Maybe inquires if the DSP is installed - radio replies G400
G105  'Sets baud rate to 38400
G300 ' Sets updating to off, so we don't get junk from the radio during setup
H1? ' Inquires if the radio is still there - radio responds H101
G301 ' Sets updating to on - radio sends back info when even occurs (squelch opens, s-meter moves, or DTMF received)
GE? ' Not known, radio replies GE02
GD? ' Not known, radio replies GD00
J4A80 ' Not known, radio replies G000
LD82000 ' Not known, radio replies G000
J8001 ' As above
J8100 ' As above
J8200 ' As above
J8300 ' As above
J4070 ' Sets the volume

Most commands not followed by interrogation, are followed by CRLF = CHR$(13)+CHR$(10)
The chains of hex codes following the command code for volume, squelch etc. are detailed in at the end of this text, they
were captured from the IC-PCR1000 software from Icom. To turn off the radio, H100 is sent.

Basic commands:
-------------------
Baud rate:
G1xx   ' Where xx=baud rate
00=300, 01=1200, 02=4800, 03=9600, 04=19200, 05=38400

Volume:
J40vv  ' Where vv=00 (minimum) to FA (maximum)

Squelch:
J41ssJ50vs   ' Where ss=01 (minimum) to FA (maximum) - the point at which s-meter squelch comes in is J4182
					            J50vs sets VSC (vs=01 for ON, vs=00 for OFF)

Tone Squelch:
J51tt   ' Where tt=00 (off) then 01 (67.0Hz) to 33 (254.1Hz)

IF Shift:
J43ii   ' Where ii=00 to FA

Frequency change:
K0GMMMKKKHHHmmff00
Where G=GHz, MMM=MHz, KKK=KHz, HHH=Hz
mm is the mode, where
00=LSB, 01=USB, 02=AM, 03=CW, 04=??(Maybe DSP setting), 05=NFM, 06=WFM
ff is the filter, where
00=3kHz, 01=6kHz, 02=15kHz, 03=50kHz, 04=230kHz

For example, 453.525, NFM, and 15kHz filter would be:
K00453525000050200
The last two zeros are probably for a DSP setting, in the standard PCR1000 they don't seem to have any effect.

Automatic Gain Control (AGC):
ON=J4501
OFF=J4500

Noise Blanker (NB):
ON=J4601
OFF=J4600

Attenuator:
ON=J4701
OFF=J4700

Voice Scan (VSC):
ON=J5001
OFF=J5000

Band Scope:
ON=ME0000114050501000ssss
OFF=ME0000114050500000ssss
Where ssss = step size in Hz
More details on this command are not know, will investigate further

Signal update from the radio:
G3xx  where
00=OFF, the program needs to inquire signal strength, DTMF tone, center, etc.)
01=ON, radio sends signal strength, DTMF tones, etc. as needed
02=Binary mode (update off)
03=Binary mode (update on)

When update is off, the program needs to interrogate the radio about the state of the signal at
any one time, and this is done with the following interrogation commands:
I0?=Squelch status
I1?=Signal strength
I2?=Signal centering
I3?=DTMF tone

The responses sent by the radio to these interrogations are:
I0ss ' Squelch open, where ss=07 open, ss=04 closed
I1ss ' Signal strength, where ss=00 (min) to FF (max) - how many steps are not known
I2sc ' Signal centering, works with the Automatic Frequency Control (AFC) of the Icom software
sc=00 when Signal Frequency < Display Frequency
sc=80 when Signal Frequency = Display Frequency
sc=FF when Signal Frequency > Display Frequency
I3dd ' DTMF tone, dd=00 when no tone present, dd=1t when a tone is received, where t=tone (note *=E, #=F)

When automatic update is turned on (G301), the radio sends a "what is going on at the moment" string, similar to

I104I280I300I004I104

This means "no signal (I104) signal centered (I280) no DTMF (I300) squelch closed (I004) no signal (I104)"
When a signal breaks the squelch, first the radio sends "Squelch open (I007)", then signal strength (I1C3 for example)
After this, it would update the data like in the following example, when status changes (spaces between responses have been
added for clarity). However, in this live update, the final digit of each response is sent twice (i.e. I0077), but it's not sure that
this has to do with the program used to capture the data.

I007 I1C3 I1C9 I1BF I004 I1A5 I191 I17E I16D I15B I149 I134 I11B I104 G300 G000
