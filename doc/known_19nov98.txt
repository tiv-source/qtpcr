All commands are sent is ASCII in the format:  Command + CR + LF

CR = chr$(13)

LF = chr$(10)



EXCEPT when in AUTOUPDATE mode (see G3xx command), when NO CR + LF IS
REQUIRED after

the Command



Note that no G0XX is returned in autoupdate mode



Some responses from the PCR1000 have an added character at the end

  of the response string.  It is usually a duplicate of the last

  character of the string and can be discarded.  (A bug, I suppose)



DTR and RTS set high by software.



When radio is first turned on, the software send the following commands:

initial boot up at 9600 Baud.



H101   Turn Radio ON

G105   Set Baud rate to 38400 Baud

G300   Set Autoupdate to OFF

H1?    Is radio still ON? Responds H100 for OFF, H101 for ON

Icom PCR1000 Band Scope commands.



The basic command to turn the bandscope function On is:



ME0000120050100012500 + CR + LF



The command breaks down this way:



ME00001   20050100012500

ME00001 is the preamble.  It's always the same.



ME00001 20 050100012500

        20 is the number of samples. It must be a 2 digit HEX number

represented in ASCII.  Add leading 0 if necessary.  Calculate

this number by dividing the Scope Bandwidth by the step size.  For

example in the +- 200 Khz span the total bandwidth is 400 Khz.  If the

step size is 12.5 khz then 400/12.5 is 32 or 20 Hex.  If you get a non

integer answer for the initial division then increment the sample

number by 1 or 2 (sample should be an EVEN number).  You can

arbitrarily set the sample higher(SLIGHTLY) to allow the display to

be moved inward from the edges of the scope display.



ME0000120 05 0100012500

          05 is a sample rate value that detiremines how fast the

scope is swept and in the Icom software is either 05 or 28. This is

interpreted as a hex number and must be 2 digits.  The practical values

for this runs from 01 (very fast and resource intensive) to about

70 (very slow and nearly useless).  Putting 00 here locks the PCR1000

and software up.  In the Icom software the number of samples

detiremine this value.  Sample numbers above 10 hex use 05 and those

10 Hex or lower use 28 Hex.



ME000012005 01 00012500

            01 This is the On/Off characters.  If they are 00 then

the bandscope is OFF.  If they are 01 the bandscope is ON



ME00001200501 00 012500

              00 is a padding value and must be there.



ME0000120050100 012500

                012500 is the step size expressed in HERTZ.  It must

be 6 digits long, padded with LEADING ZEROS.  Examples are 001000 for

1000 hertz (1 Khz), 030000 for 30 Khz and 100000 for 100 Khz.  The

bandscope accepts values down to at least 10 hertz but the Icom

software displays a LIMIT warning at 1 Khz and at 100 Khz.



The Band Scope commands appear to be insensitive to mode and bandwidth

except for the fact that it doesn't work in USB, LSB or CW.  It has

been hypothesized that the product detector circuitry is used by the

Band Scope.

**********************************************************************



The data is returned in 37 byte packets.  The packets begin with the

Letters NE1 followed by the 2 digit hex packet number.  The Packet

numbers run from 00 to F0 (must be 2 digits).  Typical packet numbers

would be NE100, NE170, NE180 and NE1F0.

These numbers are followed by 32 bytes that contain signal level

information for EACH sample (16 per packet).



Each byte is a hex number (in ascii) that can run from 00 to FF.  The

bytes in packet NE180 represent the first 16 samples UP from the

displayed frequency in ascending order.  The bytes in packet NE170

represent the 16 samples BELOW the displayed frequency in descending

order.  For example the following:



NE18020202020202020202020202020202020



NE1 80 20202020202020202020202020202020

NE1 is the fixed preamble



NE1 80 20202020202020202020202020202020

    80 is the packet number



NE180 20 202020202020202020202020202020

      20 is the sample signal level (20 Hex) at the displayed frequency



NE18020 20 2020202020202020202020202020

        This is the next sample level UP from the displayed freq



The next 14 values represent the next 14 sample levels.  If less samples

are needed, the higher sample levels are set to 00.  If more then 16

sanple levels are needed Up from the center freq, then the next packet

NE190 hold the values.



For the following:

NE17000000000000000001111111111111111



NE1 7000000000000000001111111111111111

NE1 is the fixed preamble



NE1 70 00000000000000001111111111111111

    70 is the packet number. Packet 70 is the first packet BELOW the

center frequency.



NE170000000000000000011111111111111 11

                                    11  This is the first sample level

BELOW the center frequency.



NE1700000000000000000111111111111 11 11

                                  11  This is the next LOWER sample

level and so on.  In this example, only 16 (10 Hex) samples were

specified. 8 samples are provided here below center freq and the

corresponding 8 above center freq would be in the NE180 packet.



If more then the 32 samples that can be displayed with NE170 and NE180

were specified then additional packets would be sent.  For example if

48(decimal) samples were specified then the following packets would be

returned: NE160 would have 8 samples (in the UPPER 8)

          NE170 would have 16 samples

          NE180 would have 16 samples

          NE190 would have 8 samples (in the LOWER 8)



Note that they are sent in ascending order from NE160 to NE190.

A rough indication of the number of packets needed for a given sample

size is (Number of samples)/16  plus 1. If the number is ODD then add

1 more packet.



Sample in order sent (This is a continous string):

NE1600000000000000000000030180FA61F14

NE19001030101012701000000000000000000



When Band Scope is first turned ON or is turned OFF, ALL 16 packets

are returned with ALL samples set to 00.

The DSP commands below have to be sent as a packet

  Returns GD00 if NO DSp installed

Autoupdate must be ON (send G301 + cr + lf):



J8001  Always the same



J81xx  where xx is 00 if DSP is OFF and 01 if ON



J82xx  This is the ANR function (Automatic Noise Reduction)

       xx is 00 if ANR is OFF.  If ON, xx varies from 01 to 0F

       when you turn a knob on the new DSP Popup panel.



J83xx  is the Automatic Notch filter.  xx is 00 if notch

       is OFF and 01 if ON.



The following data is written to the PCR1000.ini file.



DSPON  with either 0 or 1 for Off/On

DSPANF with either 0 or 1 for Off/On

DSPNR  with either 0 or 1 for Off/On

DSPNRLEVEL with value 0 to 15 for Noise Reduction level

Write Command:

LD0xxyy xx = address yy = data to write

Replies G000 if OK





To put protection back on again turn the PCR-1000 off and on again.

Use the software command H100 or the switch.

The baud rate will then return to 9600.





Average Values

Use these if you have a corrupted EEPROM and no backup





Crash Pattern

This is what the PCR-1000 produces if it crashes and corrupts the EEPROM

Still looking for the purpose of the following PCR commands:-



LE20050

LE20040



Above used by icom in their EEPROM routines in their software for setting up

the radio and also some third party software I have seen. Is this
understood or

is it just being copied? Superstition or white man's magic?





GCD0

GE07



H800



LD840?

LD846?

LD84A?





LD842

LD844

LD848

LD860

LD862





G4? returns G410



J4A80



If anyone fill in the gaps that would be great!
